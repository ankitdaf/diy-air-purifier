## Parts used

1. MI Air Purifier HEPA Filter - https://store.mi.com/in/item/3194500020
   This is the HEPA filter that removes particulate matter and cleans the air that flows through it
   
2. Exhaust Fan (150 mm) - https://www.amazon.in/Unleash-Exhaust-Kitchen-Bathroom-Ventilation/dp/B0BWNTNTNM/
   This causes air to be pulled in uniformly through the filter and thrown out

3. 3D Coupler - Custom designed, 3D printed
   This part does a few things :
   * Sits snugly on top of the filter and eliminates the need for tape. This makes the filter easily replaceable when required
   * It allows the fan to be slid in / out easily and held in place above the filter. This allows for easy cleaning of the fan since it will accumulate dust
   * It absorbs vibrations and prevents the purifier from moving around. Taping the fan directly to the filter caused vibrations to transfer to the filter which caused it to move around and tug at the cable

4. Zebronics Smart Plug - https://www.amazon.in/Zebronics-ZEB-SP110-Compatible-Assistant-Dedicated/dp/B08F3PTSLZ/
   This allows the purifier to be enabled / disabled at will, and at fixed schedules. This way, the purifier is scheduled to run right before people are expected to occupy rooms.
   This reduces fatigue from the continuous low humming sound of the fan
